1. Copy ./doc.css to your ikiwiki compiled site
2. Edit the templates ./page.tmpl and ./misc.tmpl 
   to point to the public doc.css file
3. rebuild wiki.

I've only done the bare minimum to make my 
[bare-minimum install](http://d8uv.org/txt/)
work. If you want to do more with your ikiwiki,
then you'll have to do more. In the event of that
happening, patches are totally accepted.
